# Goals

- Create a website that requests users first and last name, favorite super hero, and combines them in a string similar to App 0. Hello World but this time multiple user inputs
- If input is null then default data to Joe Schmoe and Spiderman
- If input is not null then print {First Name} + " " {Last Name} + "'s favorite super hero is " + {Super Hero} + "."
- Style website
