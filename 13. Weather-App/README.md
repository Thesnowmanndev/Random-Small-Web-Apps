# Weather App

This small app is my first attempt on learning how to use JavaScript fetch and API's.

## Goals

- Learn how to use the JavaScript fetch command to pull data from RapidAPI's WeatherAPI.com data
- Output data to a section on the webpage

## Setup

1. Fork Repo
2. Open folder in VS Code / Open Terminal and type `npm install`
3. In ./src/components/weather.js input your API Key (Pref. use dotenv node package and store the keys in the .env file) !!! DONT COMMIT API KEYS / PASSWORDS / IPs / PORTS !!!
4. Once previous command is complete type `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/style.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch`
5. View page, customize, tinker, learn, enjoy!

## Concepts Covered

- WeatherAPI use
- Using the JavaScript fetch API
- Note: I did not utilize dotenv or env files because I wanted to keep the project minimal without making an express/react/angular app in case someone learning is following this repo.
