# Alerts

## Goals

- Provide a means of alerting the user when they clicked a button
- Simulate a user attempting to delete an object and alerting them they are attempting to delete something
- Populate a HTML input element requiring a word to be typed
- Check inputted word, if correct change HTML to reflect that the user deleted content

## Setup

1. Fork Repo
2. Open folder in VS Code / Open Terminal and type `npm install`
3. Once previous command is complete type `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/style.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch`
4. View page, customize, tinker, learn, enjoy!

## Concepts Covered

- Javascript Alert Messages
- Using icons in buttons
- Creating inputs with JS
- Modifying HTML based on correct input - This can be expanded on in the future to actually delete content
