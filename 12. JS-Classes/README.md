# JavaScript Classes

This small app is my practice attempt at learning JavaScript classes and constructors. Essentially this will spoof a widget of an employee dashboard. Each team member will have their own card where it will display there name, department, avatar, and metrics.

## Goals

- Use MDN web docs to learn classes in JavaScript
- Construct employees with a class
- Display employees on the dashboard

## Setup

1. Fork Repo
2. Open folder in VS Code / Open Terminal and type `npm install`
3. Once previous command is complete type `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/style.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch`
4. View page, customize, tinker, learn, enjoy!
